TileBot is a small robot designed to serve as a hands-on way 
for parents and educators to encourage children to practice 
programming via a friendly, block-based interface. Tilebot 
can be used stand-alone or can be used in conjucntion with 
other accesssories to provide goal-based incentives to 
experiemnt and learn.   

As engineering students who have all had experience with 
programming, we felt that having a friendly tool that can
be introduced in the classroom or home from a young age
will be able to help children with logical thinking as well
as problem-solving skills that can help them later in their 
academic lives. Although block-based programming tools are
already available online, a physical anthromoporphic tool
can be more encouraging and approachable for children and 
serve as a way to introduce and gamify coding and sequential 
problem-solving.
